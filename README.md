# Mapping Earthquakes

## Purpose
The Earthquake Mapping Project is a visual depiction of the difference between the magnitude of earthquakes all over the world in the last seven days. In addition, display the tectonic plates in relation to the earthquake data as well as earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5. [^1]  


## Overview
Figure 1 shows a Satellite view of where earthquakes have taken place in the last seven day.  The map also displays major earthquake events (magnitude is greater than 4.5) and the tectonic plates. The map has 2 view to choose from, Street and Satellite.

Figure 2 shows a Dark view of where earthquakes have taken place in the last seven day.  The map also displays major earthquake events (magnitude is greater than 4.5) and the tectonic plates.  The map has 3 view to choose from, Street, Satellite and Dark.
